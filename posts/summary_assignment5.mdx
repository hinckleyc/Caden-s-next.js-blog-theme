For assignment 5 I had to look at the feasibility of your research project idea. With the 9 questions
I had to answer. I was able to realize that I should be able to complete my project on time and I have
all the required software and database that is needed to complete my project. My biggest concern
about this project is that I will struggle to be able to decide what are the best stats to use that
shows the worth of any player. I will need to do more research about what are the best stats to use.
I have been looking towards more advanced metrics such as RAPTOR and RPM. I will need to be able to
figure out a good stat to use that is able to show if the player is a good defensive player or a
poor defensive player. I also think that I will be able to pick the right stats to use because I
can go back to past free agency and see if the contracts the players got were good and if the stats
that I pick relfect that the player was worth there contract.
