Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language. When working with tabular data, such as data stored
in spreadsheets or databases, pandas is the right tool for you. pandas will help you to explore,
clean, and process your data. You are also able to plot your data out of the box, using the power
of Matplotlib. You can pick the plot type (scatter, bar, boxplot,…) corresponding to your data.
Multiple tables can be concatenated both column-wise and row-wise as database-like join/merge
operations are provided to combine multiple tables of data. Data sets do not only contain numerical
data. pandas provides a wide range of functions to clean textual data and extract useful information
from it. Basic statistics (mean, median, min, max, counts…) are easily calculable. These or custom
aggregations can be applied on the entire data set, a sliding window of the data, or grouped by
categories. The latter is also known as the split-apply-combine approach. There is no need to
loop over all rows of your data table to do calculations. Data manipulations on a column work
elementwise. Adding a column to a DataFrame based on existing data in other columns is straightforward.
Selecting or filtering specific rows and/or columns? Filtering the data on a condition? Methods for
slicing, selecting, and extracting the data you need are available in pandas. pandas supports the
integration with many file formats or data sources out of the box (csv, excel, sql, json, parquet,…).
Importing data from each of these data sources is provided by function with the prefix read_*.
Similarly, the to_* methods are used to store data.
