For my prototype I showed that I will be able to use tools to be able
to get information from a website called Basketball Reference. It showed
that I will be able to use that database in order to get my information I
need from the database. After completing my prototype I feel very comfortable
using Basketball Reference in order to get the data I need to complete my
senior comp. I was worried about not being able to show the data and therefore
not be able to complete my senior comp but after the assignment I feel very
comfortable that I will be able to complete my comp without to much stress.
I also was able to learn how to use different dependicies in order to get
the data from Basketball Reference. I thought that I would only need to use
pandas in order to get the data but it turns out that I need a couple more
dependicies in order to get the data to be shown in a clear way. I'm looking
forward to working on my senior comp and be able to implement the code that I
learned during this project and be able to implement it so that it will work
with the data that I need.
