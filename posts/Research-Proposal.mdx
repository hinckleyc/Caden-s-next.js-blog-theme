Statistics in basketball have been a big part of the game for a long time. However, until recently, the teams did not take advantage of the data they were receiving based on the stats that get updated on a per-game basis. Since everyone in the world is able to see the data that is produced after every game throughout the season, it is very important that people find ways of connecting useful information that the data gives us so that the team can have an added advantage. Throughout this semester, I have been doing research on using basketball statistics to find stats that will help the front office and people in charge of player personnel identify players that will help the team and even help them see what players they shouldn’t want. Almost every NBA team, if not all, is trying to figure out how to use the data and gain an advantage over the rest of the teams. I first realized that teams were using data to get an advantage when I read the book “Moneyball” by Micheal Lewis. The book talked about how the Oakland Athletics GM Billy Beane used statistics to gain an advantage over teams like the Red Sox and the Yankees because the A’s couldn’t compete financially with the big teams in the MLB. Billy Beane thought he could gain an advantage which allowed him to sign cheap players that everyone else thought weren’t very good and get the best out of them. In recent years, many NBA teams have and still are trying to use data to get players that will help their team win more basketball games. I find this really interesting because it is very similar to solving a puzzle; one has all of the important information needed to solve the puzzle, and it’s just up to them to find how to best use that information in order to get the desired outcome. 

I have read several scholarly articles about my topic and came away thinking that no one has found a way to ensure that a player will be a good signing for the team he decides to play for. In baseball, they have been able to successfully judge free agents and know exactly how much each player is worth. NBA front offices are starting to become more analytical when it comes to signing players. It makes sense that they are trying to find a way to ensure that the players will become ”good investments” because no team wants to be paying someone millions of dollars just so they can sit on the bench and not help the team win games and championships. The articles that I read talked about finding players that have a statistical advantage that can’t always be seen just by watching their games. Often times, front office personnel think that they are capable of bringing in players that will add something beneficial for the team, but end up hurting the team by signing a bad contract that the team does not like and in turn, want to get rid of. For example, the Los Angeles Lakers signed Luol Deng in 2016 to a 4 year 72 million dollar contract but he was a poor match for the team and wasn’t performing up to the standard. Therefore, he only played 2 seasons and a total of 57 games with the Lakers before they let him go. However, since the majority of NBA contracts are fully guaranteed, the Lakers had to pay his entire contract even though Luol wasn’t on the team. In fact, he was playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2018 which meant that the Lakers and the Minnesota Timberwolves were both paying him during the 2018 season. The Lakers were able to convince Luol Deng to the remainder of his contract in smaller amounts but for a longer time frame (until 2022) in order to help the Lakers be able to get other players and be under the salary cap. This is just one example that clearly shows that there isn’t currently any way to ensure that players will be able to perform well for the team and be worth the contract that they are signed to.

The research question that I am trying to answer is what are the 3 biggest statistical categories that help ensure that a player will continue to play well and not be a bust, hindering the team's chances of winning the championship. Since the NBA salary cap isn’t extremely high, it’s important to be smart with the money teams have to pay their players. Teams cannot afford to be paying players large amounts of money if they aren’t contributing to wins and helping the team fight for the title.

The scope of my project is to see which players will be free agents in the summer of 2023. However, I will be using past free agency classes to test my hypothesis in order to see if I am isolating 3 key statistical categories that help predict that players will be key contributors to their team. I think that my project is feasible because I will be able to look back on the entire NBA history in order to figure out 3 key statistical categories that are able to project sustained success. There are certain limitations to my project; one of which is that I might not be able to find the 3 statistical categories that show players will be helpful contributors because NBA front offices have been trying to answer this question since free agency was brought into the NBA. With that being said, I am sure that I will be able to find 3 categories that are good indicators of players contributing for their team and being worth the money they are getting. 

In order to show that I would be able to access the data from Basketball Reference, I was assigned to build a prototype that scraped data from the website and displayed it in the terminal. I had to do a lot of research in order to find out the best way to webscrape Basketball Reference and that is when I found a very important tool called Pandas. Pandas is an open-source tool that is fast, powerful, and flexible for data analysis and it is built on top of the Python programming language. One great thing about Pandas was the documentation that was able to easily show me how to implement the tool in order to get the data that I need. Pandas wasn’t the only tool I needed in order to make my prototype work. I also needed BeautifulSoup which helps pull data out of HMTL(which allows me to parse Basketball-Reference.com). I also had to import re(Regular Expressions) which is a tool that I used that allowed me to find certain strings in my data set and was able to help me print the data out in the terminal window. I also needed to add from IPython.display import display which allowed to me display the data I got from Basketball Reference in my terminal. The last tool I needed to import was a tool called requests. I used requests in order to get the data from a website (Basketball-Reference.com). I wanted to get the data from the Chicago Bulls Roster and Stats portion of Basketball Reference. The tool works by sending a GET request to the website. In simple terms, a GET request is a way for you to grab data from a data source with the help of the internet. In order to show that I could pull data from Basketball Reference, I decided to pull the bulls per game stats. I was able to print out the players' names, age, along with several statistical categories such as points per game and rebounds per game. I also wanted to have some fun so I decided to try and get the players' Twitter handle if they had one by going into each player's bio on Basketball Reference and finding their handle. 

After I built this prototype, I was able to use it to pull any data that I needed from Basketball Reference. This was a big relief at the time because when I first had my idea to identify 3 key statistical categories, I was concerned about how I would be able to get the data that I need. The best part about being able to use Basketball-Reference.com is that I have almost every single game stated since the NBA was founded. Since all of the data I need to look at and parse through is on one website, it will make obtaining the pertinent data a lot easier than I expected. The prototype was able to show me that I would be able to get the exact data I need in order to answer my research question.

After I completed my prototype, I had to come up with an experiment that would put my prototype to use in order to answer a question. I decided to ask if the bull's front office paid players solely based on their 3-point percentage? In order to do that, I needed to parse the bulls per game stats and find each player's 3-point percentage. After doing that, I needed to be able to get the bulls player’s salaries for the 2021-2022 seasons. This is another benefit to using Basketball-Reference.com because it also has everyone's contract which makes it very helpful for me because I can easily get the player’s stats and contracts all in the same database. I was able to see that the Chicago Bulls front office does not pay their players more solely based on their 3-point percentage. I am aware that this is only a small experiment and in order to be able to solve my research question, I will need to do more than just prove that teams like the bulls don’t just pay their players based on their 3-point percentage; however, with this experiment, I was able to show that I could not only get data from my database but I was also able to get the salaries of the players and see that there was no correlation between the player's salaries and their 3-point percentage. 

I was able to visualize my results in the terminal window. I tried to make the data more visually appealing but I couldn’t find a way to properly do that before the due date. However, I had two tables worth of data that showed the player per game stats and then the contracts per player. The two tables made it very clear that the Bulls' front office doesn’t pay players solely based on their 3-point percentage. The two tables were very easy to read and understand because there wasn’t a lot of information within the two tables. Since I only had to show the player's 3-point percentage and their salaries, it was very easy to read my table and see that the Chicago Bulls front office decides players' salaries based on numerous factors.

There aren’t any ethical concerns when it comes to my project since all of the information I am using is made publically available. I don’t have to concern myself with anyone using my research to do anything malicious. If I was creating viruses or finding new ways to hack into computers, then that would raise serious questions about how ethical it would be to use that research. Since my research isn’t in a field with ethical concerns, I don’t have to worry about anyone using my research to hurt anybody.

The next step to developing and completing my research is to narrow down statistical categories that I think will be able to predict players' productivity for the remaining years of their careers. Once I think that I have found some of those categories, then I will use the past season and see if those categories did in fact prove right that the player was worth their contract. For example, if I think VORP(Value above replacement player) is a key stat that will ensure the player will play well in the future, I will see players' VORP in the 2010 free agency class and see if the top players in that category did in fact continue to play at a high level and deserve their contract. If I see that VORP doesn’t help predict players' effectiveness for future seasons, then I would need to find a different category.
