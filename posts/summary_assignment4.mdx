1. Summarize the knowledge gap that emerges from your chosen research area.

 The knowledge gap for my research area is how to properly use the stats from players in order to ensure they fit well and will improve the team. Many teams think that they 
 have found the right player that will work out well for the team so they pay a lot of money to ensure that the player signs with them but it turns out they don't work out
 and the team has paid a player that isn't a good player with that team and the contract looks like a disaster. Teams are constantly working to find a way to ensure that
 they make the right investments in players and not get players that don't work out well for the team.

2. How do you know that a gap exists? How does relevant literature motivate or provide justification to the completion of the gap? Identify at least four research articles or other materials which identify the gap. Please include four references in this discussion. Note: it is entirely likely that new references may need to be discovered for this discussion.

 I know that this gap exists because there are many contracts in the NBA right now that are considered "bad contracts" which means that the player is make a lot more money
 than what they are worth/producing. In one article by Shanwei Yan, talked about how teams like the Rockets are trying to use statistical analysis to evaluate a
 player’s skills, and sign low cost but good players. The author was able to find out that "It can be seen that using efficiencies and potential / defense features in the 
 classification models could generally get good prediction accuracies, which would help to evaluate basketball players’ true values and dig out under-rated players". In an
 article from USA Today talked about how nba teams are trying to turn data into wins. It talked about how NBA teams have tracking in the clothes that are worn in order to
 get a better understanding of what is happening during the games. The teams are trying to improve and using everything they can to do so. It talked about how coaches are
 trying to use the data that they are given in order to improve their teams. I found another example of the boston celtics using data in order to get a competitive edge
 on the competition. The teams are trying to get the data in the coaches and players hands in order to should them the data which will help the player better understand
 what is happening out on the court and what is working very well for them and figure out ways to change the things that are underperforming. The last article I picked
 was how a player's actions both on the court and off the court affected the contract that they would get and how it affected the team. The author, Nuoya Li found through is
 second regression was able to see that signing a player who could not get a lot of points or who made too many turnovers in his contract year or signing a player with a
 relatively big contract.

3. State and introduce at least one research question that, when answered, will fill the knowledge gap.

 What is the best way to know how much money a NBA free agent is worth? When this question is answered you will see that the number of "bad contracts" in the NBA will plummet,
 because the team will be able to know exactly how much to give a player in free agency.

4. Broadly, describe the steps that you will take to answer the research question(s), and fill the knowledge gap.

 In order to be able to answer my research question and fill the knowledge gap I first will have to identify some key stats that will allow me to better understand a players
 value to a team. After I am able to find the best stats that truly reflect how much a player contributes to winning them I must check and make sure that these stats are the
 correct ones to use. I will do this by using the seeing if the stats that I choose reflect on past players that have either helped teams win more or did the opposite and
 hurt the team that they signed for. Once I am able to ensure that stats I choose do in fact help mitigate the risk of signing player then I will use it on the upcoming
 free agent class and be able to say what contracts they are worth. This will fill the knowledge gap because it will help team be able to figure out what the best way to
 allocate their resources.
