In order to be able to complete this assignment, I had to do a lot of research in order to find the right articles
that help show that there is a knowledge gap when it comes to correctly deciding how much to pay players. I was
able to see that the NBA teams are investing in using data to help get more wins. This shows that the front
office of the NBA teams are trying to find ways to use data in order to give them an advantage against other teams.
The knowledge gap that I want to try and fix is how should teams spend their money in free agency in order to
make their team better and also not be stuck with a bad contract. Far too often do NBA teams splurge in free agency
but it doesn't work out for them because the player and team don't mesh well. In order for teams to be able to not
make that mistake, they are trying to use data to ensure that they are making the right investment and not be stuck
with a player that is getting paid much more than he is worth. In order to be competitive in the NBA teams must not
have players with bad contracts due to the salary cap restraints, which makes finding the data and using it correctly
very important.
