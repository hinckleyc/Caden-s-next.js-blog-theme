Since I wanted to compare the bullsâ€™ players 3-point % and their salaries. After being able to get the data from 
 basketball-reference I was able to compare each players 3 point % and salaries and I found that the Chicago Bulls
 front office doesn't pay players based off their 3-point %. In order for me to answer my question for my comp
 I will need to find out what the best stats are to look at I will have to figure out what stats not to look at.
 I wanted to see if the Chicago Bulls front office decided to pay the players based on their three-point percentage.
 In order to do that I needed to get the data from basketball-reference and show that in order to see the necessary
 statistics to look at. Once I was able to see the information clearly, I was able to see that the Bulls front office
 doesn't solely rely on three-point percentage to see if they should pay players or how much to pay them. I will have to
 look to see what stats the Bulls front office use and to see how other teams are basing their pay for their players.
